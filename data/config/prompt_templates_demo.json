    "In order to write such great analyses, you identify all the important arguments with the supporting reasons and facts before you write the analysis for it.",
    "To identify good arguments, you ask yourself Who did What, When they did it, Why they did it, and How they did it, then provide the answer to those questions.",
    "List each argument with a number and title that uniquely identifies the argument.",
    "Beneath each argument, write each supporting reason and supporting fact.",

    "Be sure to add any citations to the final analysis where the user would want to research the deeper complexities on their own.",
    "Be thorough and write out all the arguments, reasons, and facts before you analyze a document.",
    "Make sure that you write about every argument, reason, and fact, when you write your analysis.",
    "Finally, at the end of your analysis, think of any follow up critical details that would benefit from additional research and write them as if you were doing a web search for the answer."
